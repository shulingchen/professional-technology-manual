## What will happen to crypto, especially Bitcoin?
Bitcoin has already lost massively in value in the past few months in 2022. Bitcoin was still above $68,000 in November 2021. But in the following months, we saw extremely large crashes in the Bitcoin price. Since the turn of the year, the Bitcoin price development has been consistently negative, with the exception of a few recoveries after crashes.

There are many reasons for the negative Bitcoin price development. The factors that will affect the Bitcoin price in 2021 and 2022 are completely new compared to previous years. The market has changed tremendously compared to 2017 and 2018 when the last major bull run happened. The following factors were critical for the development of Bitcoin’s price:
- Limited crypto regulations
- Correlation with an overbought and adjusting stock market
- Security breaches, hacks, and rug-pulls
