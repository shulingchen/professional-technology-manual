原则上，英语动词的及物性是基于语义定的，及物的动词语义都是操作类行为，基本上都是发生物理量的变化，而表示状态、心理活动、对待行为，都是不及物动词。

但语言学习不能当理科学习，还是依靠死记硬背，多阅读，多记一下动词的介词搭配

## 有些动词既是及物又是不及物
既可有宾语，又可无需宾语，意思照样成立的双面动词
既是及物又是不及物。

- eat 
```
He is eating.
不及物,吃

He is eating an apple.
及物,吃苹果
```
- bend
```
He bent his back.
及物,弯腰

His head was bent over her book.
及物,埋头

Can you bend down?
不及物:下弯，弯下
```

- help
```
及物
I helped him to fix his car.

不及物
I was only trying to help.
