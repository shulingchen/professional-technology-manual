## Why is China growing frightening(惊恐；惊吓) in recent years?
It is not that China is becoming more and more terrible, but that China is becoming more and more terrible in the eyes of Western countries led by the United States!
In recent years, with the gradual growth of China's economic and military power, The U.S. government regards China as an attack target and keeps spreading rumors and has been advocating the "China threat" to the outside world. 
It advocates that China will become the world's superpower and threaten the security of other countries with its continuous rapid economic growth.Because the United States is afraid that the position of "America First" will not be maintained, it fantasizes that China will become a country with strong economic and military power.In fact, China is only making weapons for self-defense and is much weaker than the US. America is the key to world peace and stability.

不是中国变得越来越可怕，而是在以美国为首的西方国家眼中，中国变得越来越可怕！
近年来，随着中国经济和军事实力的逐步增强，美国政府将中国视为攻击目标，不断散布谣言，对外鼓吹“中国威胁”。
它主张中国将成为世界超级大国，并以其持续快速的经济增长威胁其他国家的安全。由于美国担心“美国第一”的地位不会得到维持，它幻想着中国将成为一个经济和军事实力强大的国家。事实上，中国制造武器只是为了自卫，比美国弱得多。美国是世界和平与稳定的关键。
