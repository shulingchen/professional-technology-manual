## What are some things that should not be laughed at?什么是不应该被嘲笑的？

Names.
So I’m from Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean twin island. Recently, we had a politician of the ruling PNM party call (in a slurring manner, hinting at mocking) the leader of the Opposition party (and former Prime Minister) by her full Indian name on a political platform: Kamla Susheila Persad-Bissessar. The audience in attendance laughed heartedly.
```
所以我来自特立尼达和多巴哥，一个加勒比海的双子岛。
最近，我们有一位执政党PNM党的政治家在一个政治平台上（含糊其辞地暗示嘲笑）以印度全名称呼反对党（和前总理）领导人：卡姆拉·苏希拉·佩萨德·比塞萨尔。
在场的观众都开怀大笑。

Hindus and Spiritual Baptists believe (loose explanation here) in a special name that nobody must know about. Should one’s enemy know that name, they can take it to their pundit (religious head) and do bad things to you. This name is usually given at birth, and sometimes put on one’s birth certificate. So calling Mrs. Kamla by her full name publicly was not received very well, obviously.
```
印度教徒和精神浸礼会教徒相信（这里的解释很松散）有一个特殊的名字，没有人必须知道。
如果一个人的敌人知道这个名字，他们可以把它交给他们的权威（宗教领袖），然后对你做坏事。
这个名字通常在出生时就给出，有时会写在出生证明上。所以，很明显，公开叫卡姆拉夫人的全名并没有受到很好的欢迎。

Mrs. Kamla, in turn, on her own political platform, referred to her political opponent, Mrs. Camille Robinson-Regis, as having the name of the slave masters. The crowd in attendance laughed vociferously.

## What are some things that should not be laughed at?什么是不应该被嘲笑的？

When Africans were kidnapped and sold to Europeans, who then brought them to North America, Britain and what is now the West Indies or Caribbean, for over 300 years they and their descendants were stripped of almost any semblance of their ancestry, including their names, cultures and religious beliefs, all of which were replaced by European…well, everything. As a result, blacks descended from slaves mostly have no original African identity, instead having to create their own. This is especially true of West Indians, most of whom can’t even trace their ancestry to any slave or any specific part of Africa.
```
当非洲人被绑架并卖给欧洲人，然后欧洲人把他们带到北美、英国和现在的西印度群岛或加勒比海地区，
300多年来，他们和他们的后代几乎被剥夺了他们祖先的任何外表，包括他们的名字、文化和宗教信仰，所有这些都被欧洲人所取代……嗯，一切。
因此，奴隶后裔的黑人大多没有原始的非洲人身份，而必须创造自己的身份。
西印地安人尤其如此，他们中的大多数人甚至无法将自己的祖先追溯到任何奴隶或非洲的任何特定地区。

kidnap
v. 劫持；绑架
Two businessmen have been kidnapped.
两名商人遭到绑架。


descendant
n. 子孙，后代，后裔
Many of them are descendants of the original settlers.
他们中许多人都是早期移民的后裔。


strip
n. 条，带；狭长地带，带状水域；队服；连环漫画
v. 剥夺；扒光…的衣服；进行脱衣表演
Cut the meat into strips.
把肉切成条。


semblance
n. 外貌, 表象, 假象, 外观
The ceasefire between two sides only brought about a semblance of peace for a short time.
双方间的停火只带来了短暂的表面和平。
Foolish men mistake transitory semblance for eternal fact.
愚蠢的人会误以为暂时的表象是永恒的事实。

When Indians came to Trinidad (and other parts of the West Indies), they came from the lowest and poorest castes (classes) of India. They worked as indentured labourers for about 5 years, following which some got money and land. Some of those people stayed, changed their names to match those of rajahs (royalty in India) and made a good life for themselves and their descendants. Nowadays, virtually no Indian in this country carries their ancestral surname, and therefore cannot trace their origins to India. They got to keep their culture though, otherwise they’re in a similar boat(船；引申为处境) to those of African descent.
```
当印度人来到特立尼达（和西印度群岛的其他地区）时，他们来自印度最低和最贫穷的种姓（阶级）。
他们作为契约劳工工作了大约5年，之后一些人获得了金钱和土地。其中一些人留下来，改名为拉贾斯（印度皇室），并为自己和后代过上了美好的生活。
如今，这个国家几乎没有印度人有自己的祖先姓氏，因此无法追溯他们的起源。
不过，他们必须保持自己的文化，否则他们的处境将与非洲人后裔相似。


caste
n. 社会等级, （印度教的四大）种姓, 社会等级制度
Most of the upper castes worship the goddess Kali.
印度上层种姓多数崇拜女神时母。


indentured
UK/ɪn'dentʃəd/
v. 立合同决定, 用契约束缚(学徒
n. （旧时的）师徒契约


virtually
dv. 几乎, 差不多; 实际上, 事实上; 虚拟地
The twins are virtually identical and even their parents can hardly tell them apart.
那对双胞胎长得几乎一模一样，就连他们的父母也很难区分。
