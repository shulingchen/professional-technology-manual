## What is correct, “this” or “these”?
This and these are demonstratives, which means they indicate a specific noun in a sentence. The two words are similar because they refer to nouns that are near in space and time. This is used with singular or uncountable nouns (i.e. this egg or this music). These refers to plural nouns (i.e. these cookies). When the noun is omitted after this and these, they become pronouns (i.e. turn this off when you leave).

Demonstratives are words we use to indicate nouns in a sentence. They point out specific nouns that are near or far in time and space. Demonstratives clarify the difference between an apple and this apple. The four most common demonstratives are this, that, these, and those.

这个和这些都是指示词，这意味着它们表示句子中的特定名词。这两个词很相似，因为它们指的是在空间和时间上相近的名词。这用于单数或不可数名词（即这个蛋或这个音乐）。这些是指复数名词（即这些饼干）。当名词在this和these之后省略时，它们就变成了代词（也就是说，当你离开时把它关掉）。
指示词是我们用来表示句子中名词的词。他们指出在时间和空间上接近或遥远的特定名词。指示词阐明了苹果和这个苹果的区别。四个最常见的指示词是this、that、this和that。
